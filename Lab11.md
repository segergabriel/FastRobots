## Localization (Real)

### Lab Objective


Last lab I demonstrated the effectiveness of the Bayes filter in a simulation. In this lab I will perform localization with the Bayes filter on the actual robot. Only the update step of the Bayes filter will be used as the motion is very noisy and the prediction step will therefore not be helpful.
