## LAB 5: Linear PID control and Linear interpolation

### Lab Objective

In this lab, PID control was implemented on the robot, using one of the ToF sensors to simulate the simplest form of control.

### Prelab

#### Sending and receiving data over Bluetooth

pics of buffers

pics of case

pics of jupyter, used same as before but added things

Consider adding code snippets as necessary to showcase how you implemented this on Arduino and Python




### Lab Tasks


### Range/Sampling time discussion

98 ms /s

pic of motor vs distance

code output of time between loop

write about thism calculations too

### PID Discussion 

kp first, go over all values

### PID Implementation

### Results

Videos and explaining them

grpahs distance vs time



Graph data should include Tof vs time and Motor input vs time (and whatever helps with debugging)
also all tips
